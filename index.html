            I am running for city council because I believe the growth of the
            city to be the biggest issue in the next few years. Having served on
            the planning & zoning commission for the past 6.5 years, I feel
            prepared to guide the direction of growth, by following the city's
            general plan and motto "Country Living at Its Finest." I would like
            to see development that does not choke out our animals and
            agriculture in place of cars and pavement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another reason I am running is because I would like to see more
            equal geographic representation. I live in southeast Millville.
            Currently, there are no elected officials who live south of 300
            North.
          </p>
          <p>I love Millville and want to be involved.</p>

            <h3>A proven leader with deep community roots</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Darcy Ripplinger. I grew up in southeast Millville on
              canyon road. My parents are Doug and Luann Pehrson. I moved back
              10 years ago after 11 years in Nibley. I have deep roots in
              Millville, including four great-great-great grandparents buried in
              the Millville/Nibley Cemetery as early as 1883.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am married to Jacob Ripplinger who is the son of Robert and
              Joleen Ripplinger. Jake also grew up in Millville, what he calls
              “downtown” Millville. I am a proud conservative and the mother of
              four children.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in public service started with a few experiences in
              high school at Mountain Crest. Then, I graduated from USU in 2003
              with a bachelor's degree in Psychology. In 2018, I joined the
              Planning and Zoning Commission and have really enjoyed my time
              there. I've learned a lot and really respect the other
              commissioners and the genuine care and concern they have for our
              city. In 2022, I became more involved with the Cache County
              Republican party organization and I now I currently serve as the
              Millville 2nd Precinct Chair. I feel this time has prepared me for
              service on the next level.

            <h3>What I Would Like to Improve</h3>
            <p>
              If elected I would request more transparency in our government,
              improve access in our public meetings and records including
              agendas and minutes (ask me for specifics). I would also like to
              explore the option of adding funds in the budget for installing
              more sidewalks to support walking off of our narrow, busy, and
              often bumpy roads. I would also like to explore partnering with
              Hyrum city for library service. These improvements would have
              little impact on the already tight budget but provide valuable
              services to the citizens.

            </div>
            <h3>Growth</h3>
            <p>
              I believe the growth of the city to be the biggest issue in the
              next few years. Serving on the Planning and Zoning has prepared me
              to help direct growth in a way that works with developers to help
              growth that makes sense to Millville. I would like to maintain the
              rural feel of Millville.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t want our growth to be like a flash flood that will
              overwhelm our infrastructure and water supply. I will fight to
              keep development at a slower pace, 2-3% per year.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to see commercial development only in specified areas
              according to our city’s general plan, close to the highway to
              mitigate the impact to our residents but provide an improved tax
              revenue.

            <h3>Statement of interests</h3>
            <p>
              I have a great love for Millville and a desire to be a part of
              Millville’s future, and this election is very important to that
              future. I would like to improve relationships with the schools and
              the cemetery board. My desire to run for City Council has nothing
              to do with hard feelings against the city or schools, a business
              to support, or any development interests.

            <h3>Commitments</h3>
            <p>
              I feel prepared to hit the ground running from day one of service.
              If elected, I commit to listen to citizens. I commit to making
              meeting attendance a high priority. I commit to work hard to serve
              our city. I commit to becoming educated to the role of a city
              council member and the needs of our citizens. I commit to fight to
              retain our agricultural heritage and slower growth. I commit to
              maintain our motto: Country Living at Its Finest.
